# This directory stores archived implementation records.
# Each completed issue creates a subdirectory:
#   archive/YYYY-MM-DD-issue-N-slug/
#     - prd.json          (task state snapshot)
#     - issue-comments.md (GitHub comments export)
#     - SUMMARY.md        (human-readable summary)
#
# These archives provide:
# - Historical record of implementation decisions
# - Reference for similar future issues
# - Audit trail for completed work
